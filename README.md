- 👋 Hi, I’m @CollectSpiders
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Snowboarding, Paintball, silly baubles, and cooking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code? maybe program? not entirely sure, I have a friend who's real passionate about coding and I'm looking for a career path that interests me so I'm trying it out.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... absolutely nothing, or I guess you could just go with the above. so learning.
- 📫 How to reach me. . . tricky question if I don't know you I probably won't answer, but my email is probably your best bet otherwise.
